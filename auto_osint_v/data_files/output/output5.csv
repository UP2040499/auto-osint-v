This month, officials from the world’s seven largest advanced economies, a group known as the G7, are expected to vow to work towards measures that make it harder to sell Russian diamonds in their nations, in a bid to squeeze Moscow’s access to finance, and — they hope — impede the Kremlin’s ability to wage war on Ukraine.⁠

Any changes the G7 makes would not just affect Russia though. It could also strangle the wider diamond industry, say those who work in it.

Watchdog Rospotrebnadzor said branches on Pushkin Square, the first McDonald's opened in Russia in 1990, Manezh Square and Prospect Mira in central Moscow would be temporarily shut as part of an ongoing investigation into the chain's food standards.  Several politicians, including the nationalist Vladimir Zhirinovsky, have criticised the chain and called for the country to close all McDonald's outlets in Russia after the burger chain announced it would close its branches in the Crimean peninsula in April.  The closures come against a backdrop of worsening US-Russian ties over the crisis in Ukraine. Earlier this month, the Kremlin banned food imports from the West in retaliation over Russia's alleged involvement with separatists suspected of shooting down a passenger plane flying over rebel territory on 17 July.

The threat of tougher penalties came from the US ambassador to the UN, Samantha Power in an interview on ABC’s This Week.  “The forces are doing in each six or seven cities that they have been activing exactly the same thing.  So certainly it bears the tell-tale signs of Moscow’s involvement. And if actions like the kind we’ve seen over the last few days continue, you’re going to see a ramping up of those sanctions.”  However, Russia’s Foreign Minister Sergei Lavrov said Kyiv was “demonstrating its inability to take responsibility for the fate of the country.”  Meanwhile, NATO Secretary General Anders Fogh Rasmussen has repeated his concern about similarities in some of the separatists’ appearance to that of Russian troops who seized control in Crimea.
