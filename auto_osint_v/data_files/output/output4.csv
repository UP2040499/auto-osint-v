By annexing these regions, Russia under its own law, will be allowed to deploy its newly conscripted units to fight in these areas as they are now considered to be part of Russia rather than foreign soil. This is significant because all of the regions are under partial Ukrainian control. Moreover, control of Kherson and Zaporizhzhia will allow for both a land bridge to Crimea from Russia and guarantee the region fresh water access. As a result, any chances for a peace deal in the short-term are diminished. It would also appear unlikely for there to be a Minsk II-style agreement where Zaporizhzhia and Kherson could be granted autonomous status within Ukraine and Page Type: website Published on: ",60,"neutral sentiment, score=0.9552721977233887"
