He said that strategy documents tend to be sound and well written but too often “get caught up in buzz words and catchphrases that don’t have much meaning,” and it is their implementation that is a challenge.

The Russian-Ukrainian negotiations in Turkey on Tuesday showed a Russia more realistic about the course of its war but in no hurry to end it, according to diplomats and analysts.  Russia’s deputy defense minister, Aleksandr Fomin, presented the decision to “sharply reduce” military activity around the capital, Kyiv, and the northern city of Chernihiv as a gesture “to increase mutual trust for future negotiations.”  But the Russian advance in the north had already stalled, with Russia’s troops around Kyiv taking up defensive positions in the Page Type: article Published on: ",20,"neutral sentiment, score=0.5468081831932068"

66,Corroboration,"Willem Marx on Instagram: ""American forces have been stationed in Germany since the end of the Second World War, and at the height of the Cold War there were several hundred thousand U.S. soldiers based in the country to deter Soviet aggression. 

Today, there are still 36,000 American troops spread across a number of German military facilities, now in theory supporting NATO and offering deterrence to Russia. President Trump announced this summer that he wanted to slash that number by a third, with the Pentagon announcing that more than 6,400 soldiers would return to the United States, and around 5,600 redeploying elsewhere in Europe. 

Former military commanders and national security officials have said this plan is a mistake, while Joe Biden's campaign told us it was ""irresponsible."" So we went to southern Germany to understand the potential implications for European security of this highly contested decision by the Trump administration.
