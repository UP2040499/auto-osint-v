At 19, I got a tattoo of the Ukrainian coat of arms‚Äîthe ‚ÄòTryzub‚Äô which represents a trident, gyrfalcon, and volya, our word for freedom‚Äîso I could always carry a piece of home with me.

Yesterday, Russian forces invaded Ukraine‚ÄîAGAIN. To be clear, this was an unprovoked, blatant act of war against my country. It is not a peacekeeping mission. To associate that word with Russian military forces and Putin‚Äôs political, imperial agenda is a total perversion of its meaning.

Right now, there‚Äôs a power greater than myself that wants to erase me, my family, my history, my identity, and my country.

66,Corroboration,"Willem Marx on Instagram: ""American forces have been stationed in Germany since the end of the Second World War, and at the height of the Cold War there were several hundred thousand U.S. soldiers based in the country to deter Soviet aggression. 

Today, there are still 36,000 American troops spread across a number of German military facilities, now in theory supporting NATO and offering deterrence to Russia. President Trump announced this summer that he wanted to slash that number by a third, with the Pentagon announcing that more than 6,400 soldiers would return to the United States, and around 5,600 redeploying elsewhere in Europe. 

Former military commanders and national security officials have said this plan is a mistake, while Joe Biden's campaign told us it was ""irresponsible."" So we went to southern Germany to understand the potential implications for European security of this highly contested decision by the Trump administration.
